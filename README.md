translate English-based programming languages to be more inviting for those in non-English countries

This is an idea I had after reading an article about the [prevelance of english within programming](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/coding-is-for-everyoneas-long-as-you-speak-english/amp). 
After realising how english centric the world of software is and how uninviting it can be for those with non-english backgrounds, I began looking around to see if there have been other attempts at resolving this problem. Although some language specific attempts exist (and some even [quite successful](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme)), I was unable to find any that acted as a general tool and so I thought I would do my part by making a tool that could hopefully solve this or atleast provide a starting point for a solution to this problem. 

This is a relatively simple translation tool at its current stage. It takes in a translation file that acts as a mapping or dictionary from one language to another. It then applies this dictionary to a file to translate it from one language to another.
